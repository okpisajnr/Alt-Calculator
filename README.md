# Alt-Calculator
I am Demonstrating my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity by building a functional calculator.
## Figma Link: Use this design as a guide
üìù Instructions:
Build a simple calculator web app that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

N.B: It should look exactly like the design

1. HTML (Structure)
Create buttons for digits 0-9.
Include buttons for operators: +, -, √ó, √∑, =, and C (clear).
Provide an input field or a display area to show the current expression and result.
2. CSS (Styling)
Style the calculator using CSS to make it visually appealing.
Ensure responsive layout (the calculator should work on both desktop and mobile devices).
Apply hover effects or transitions for button interaction (bonus points).
3. JavaScript (Functionality)
Make the calculator functional using JavaScript.
Users should be able to click on buttons to build expressions and view results.
The = button should evaluate the expression and display the result.
The C button should clear the current input.
